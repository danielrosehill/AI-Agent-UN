## Notes:

This resolution follows standard UN General Assembly format and incorporates:
- Recognition of the ceasefire while emphasizing it's only a first step
- Balance between immediate humanitarian concerns and long-term peace objectives
- References to international law and the two-state solution
- Mechanisms for implementation and accountability
- Non-binding language typical of GA resolutions ("calls upon," "urges," "welcomes")

In practice, the actual text would be subject to extensive negotiation, with different blocs proposing amendments reflecting their specific concerns and priorities.
