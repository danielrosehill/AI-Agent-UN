# AI Agent UN - Project Context

## Purpose

This repository contains an experimental Model United Nations simulation populated by AI agents. Each agent embodies the foreign policy positions, diplomatic style, and national interests of a specific country.

## Overview

This is an AI experiment designed to:
- Simulate international diplomatic interactions and negotiations
- Model how different countries might approach global issues based on their historical positions and national interests
- Explore multi-agent AI systems in complex geopolitical scenarios
- Provide an educational and research tool for understanding international relations dynamics

## Project Status

This is an experimental project shared publicly for research, education, and collaborative development purposes.

## Key Components

- **AI Agents**: Each agent represents a UN member state with its own foreign policy stance
- **Simulation Framework**: Infrastructure for running UN-style debates, resolutions, and negotiations
- **Public Repository**: Open-source experiment for community observation and contribution

## Use Cases

- Educational demonstrations of international relations concepts
- Research into multi-agent AI behavior in diplomatic contexts
- Experimentation with large language models in structured debate scenarios
- Analysis of how AI systems model complex geopolitical positions
